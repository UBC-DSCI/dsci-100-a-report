# DSCI 100 - Introduction to Data Science

*Use of data science tools to summarize, visualize, and analyze data. Sensible workflows and clear interpretations are emphasized*

# Design Intent

<img src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/--nwHn7d6qbk/Vs8ukMIaVmI/AAAAAAAAej8/fBg9o4i2i58/s1600/good-intentions.jpg" width="700">

# Design Intent

1. Introduce Data Science to undergraduates in an authentic way

--

2. Use pedagogical best practices for teaching Data Science

--

3. Reducing barriers to entry and success

---

# Learner Personas

prerequisite: MATH 12

--

*Emily is a first year undergraduate who is thinking of becoming a data analyst after she graduates. She only has grade 12 Math. She has heard of the R programming language and knows it is used at her university in many statistics courses (which she plans to take) but never used it (or any other programming language) before. She is finding university very financially challenging and can only afford a Chrome book.*

--

*Mohammed is fourth year Biology undergraduate who plans to attend graduate school next year. His undergraduate honours thesis project requires analysis of data sets that are too big to be opened in JMP, the only data analysis software he has ever used. His thesis supervisor suggested he learn R to do the analysis. The supervisor gave him a book to read to do this, but Mohammed is having a hard time staying motivated doing this on his own without any feedback.*

# High-level learning goals of this course

At the end of the course, students will know how to:

--

- Use modern reproducible tools (Jupyter notebooks, R, `tidyverse` & `caret` R packages) to do data analysis

--

- Recognize when a data science problem can be solved by classification, regression\* or clustering (_ \* in a predictive context only_)

--

- Use R to solve classification, regression and clustering problems, and correctly interpret and communicate the results

---

# Introduce Data Science to undergraduates in an authentic way

--

- Practice what you preach (e.g., teaching materials & tools)

--

- Give students the opportunity to learn and practice with Data Science tools and workflows

---

# Lecture pre-readings

No modern yet accessible textbooks available that are suitable for our target learners...

--

... so we wrote our own using the `bookdown` R package!

- Jupyter notebooks are literate code documents similar to R Markdown

- Markdown and LaTeX rendering in developing environment makes them easier to read while editing

- notebooks can be manually or autograded using an open source tool, [nbgrader](https://nbgrader.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)

# Use pedagogical best practices for teaching Data Science

# Case studies

Each topic was taught within the context of Data Science case studies:

# Practice with immediate feedback

- autograding via nbgrader has the added advantage that students can run the test to assess if their answer is correct

--

- *they also get to learn about tests as a side-affect*

--

- we used 3 types of exercises:
    - multiple choice questions
    - code & run with fill in the blanks
    - classic code & run

# Active learning in-class activites

Most lectures and some tutorials had in-class activities, examples include:

--

- pair/group programming challenges

--

- tactile data re-shaping

--

- dance/role-play of algorithms

---

## Example pair/group programming challenge

**Instructions to students:** Can petal length and width be used to separate the Iris flower species? Create an effective plot to answer this question! When you are done, share your code on the class forum.

**Then bring everyone together to discuss a solution from the class forum:**

---

## Example pair/group programming challenge

The screens in the DSCI 100 classroom greatly facilitated these activites:

---

## Example tactile data re-shaping

At the beginning of a tutorial on classification of the handwritten digits data set it is very hard for students to understand how you go from images like those shown below to tabular data for k-nn classification.

<img src="https://assets.digitalocean.com/articles/handwriting_tensorflow_python3/wBCHXId.png">

---

## Example tactile data re-shaping

<img src="img/grids.png" width="500">

**Materials:** scissors, tape & printed images (above)

**Exercise:** For each grid:
- give each square an estimated value for pixel intensity (0 for completely white, 1 for completely black)
- use the scissors to cut the printed images into rows
- with tape, paste the rows together to get a single row  

---

## Example dance/role-play of algorithms

To reinforce the algorithm behind Kmeans clustering:

<img src="img/kmeans_materials.png" width="550">

**Set-up:**
- TA's wear coloured t-shirts & students have a post it of each colour
- one post-it note for each student has an asterisk (random)

**Exercise:**
1. students hold up post-it with asterisk 
2. TA's move the center of the students holding up the colour corresponding to their shirt
3. students look for the closest TA and update the colour of the post-it they are holding to match
4. iterate over 2 & 3 until things stop changing

# Reducing barriers to entry and success

---

# Reducing barriers to entry and success

- Gender and cultural minorities are under represented in STEM (ref)

--

- Our aim was to remove as many barriers as possible for entry and success in DSCI 100 in hopes to help foster diversity in Data Science at least at the entry level

---

# Reducing barriers to entry and success

- Minimal pre-requisites (MATH 12)

--

- Anonymous class discussion forum (Piazza)

--

- [Formal and public course code of conduct](https://ubc-dsci.github.io/dsci-100/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.html)

--

- **Web server to provide access to homework via the course learning management system (LMS) on any device (laptop, chromebook, ipad) that the student owns or borrows from the university's library.**


---

## A JupyterHub server accessed via the course LMS

--

- Did not want to relying on computer labs and/or managing student installation of course software

--

- Students access homework and necessary software via a button inside course LMS (e.g., Canvas, EdX)

---

## Experiment with JupyterHub yourself!

The below links let you access the homework for DSCI 100 via a JupyterHub server that uses Google authentication (and therefore open to everyone):
