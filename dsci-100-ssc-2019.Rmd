# Design Intent

- introduce Data Science to undergraduates in an authentic way

--

- use pedagogical best practices for teaching Data Science

--

- reducing barriers to entry and success

---

# Learner Personas

prerequisite: MATH 12

--

*Emily is a first year undergraduate who is thinking of becoming a data analyst after she graduates. She only has grade 12 Math. She has heard of the R programming language and knows it is used at her university in many statistics courses (which she plans to take) but never used it (or any other programming language) before. She is finding university very financially challenging and can only afford a Chrome book.*

--

*Mohammed is fourth year Biology undergraduate who plans to attend graduate school next year. His undergraduate honours thesis project requires analysis of data sets that are too big to be opened in JMP, the only data analysis software he has ever used. His thesis supervisor suggested he learn R to do the analysis. The supervisor gave him a book to read to do this, but Mohammed is having a hard time staying motivated doing this on his own without any feedback.*

# High-level learning goals of this course

At the end of the course, students will know how to:

--

- use modern reproducible tools (Jupyter notebooks, R, `tidyverse` & `caret` R packages) to do data analysis

--

- recognize when a data science problem can be solved by classification\*, regression\* or clustering

--

- use R to solve classification, regression and clustering problems, and correctly interpret and communicate the results

--

_ \* in a predictive context only_

# Course organization and mechanics


.pull-left[

- Two 90 min meetings a week (lecture + tutorial)

- 3/4 flipped classroom

- paperless course

- ~ 60% of assessments were autograded

# Introduce Data Science to undergraduates in an authentic way

---

# Keeping it real

- real world datasets
- modern and industry standard software
- analytic methods to solve common Data Science problems

---

# Lecture pre-readings

No modern yet accessible textbooks available that are suitable for our target learners...

--

... so we wrote our own using the `bookdown` R package!
